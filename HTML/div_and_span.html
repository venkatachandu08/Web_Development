    <h3>Div and Span</h3>
    <!--div and span are used for grouping-->
    <!--div is a generic container-->
    <!--div is used to group things together-->





    <p>The div tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document. The div tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.
        The p tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.</p>
